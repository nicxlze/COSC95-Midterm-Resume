          <p>Hello! I'm Nicole Almonicar, a Computer Science student at Cavite State University - Bacoor City Campus with a passion for software development. My journey into tech began with a deep curiosity about computers, inspiring me to pursue a Computer Science degree and dive into the world of programming and software development.</p>
            
          <p>I’ve had hands-on experience working on both individual and collaborative projects, which has strengthened my skills in various programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and NoSQL. I’m eager to gain practical experience through internships and collaborative projects, where I can further apply and expand my skills.</p>
        
          <p>I’m also highly motivated to learn new tools and technologies that will help me grow into a well-rounded software developer. I look forward to connecting with goal-oriented professionals and contributing to innovative projects!</p>
